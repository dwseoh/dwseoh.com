For most of us, every day is a push: a quiet sprint to be better versions of ourselves, or at least to try. Momentum carries us forwards. It shows up in a week-long hackathon grind, five-hour LeetCode sprints, or if you think about it more literally, a simple run outside! But like in physics, momentum isn’t eternal. Forces beyond our control like friction or air resistance (barriers, setbacks, storms) will slow us down or sometimes completely stop us. 

Running full tilt feels like flying across endless horizons. The wind in your face, the drop of sunshine that you brush against, and the beautiful sceneries; everything feels perfect. Until a storm hits, and suddenly, everything can go wrong very quicky. Momentum stalls. Perhaps you become stranded in an island middle of nowhere, soon to be caught in quicksand. Falling feels endless and nights brings questions you can’t answer: “Why am I here? Why did I run all the way here? All those countless nights of dedication and hard work, just to end up more lost? What is the point of it all?”

I’ve been there. Through identity crises, self-doubt, and the weight of society’s expectations, I’ve felt the ground give way. The uncertainty presses in, grey and heavy. But even in that stillness, I’ve learned something essential: you will find your way. You will pause, breathe, and see what’s around you. 

Remember the friends who laughed with you, the nights spent doing what you love, and the fleeting moments where you skipped a heartbeat. Recall your family and those special to you. Think of those who couldn’t reach their dreams, those silenced by tragedy. Whoever they may be, they are rooting for you. Let their hopes, and your own, pull you forward. You fight not just for yourself, but for the world that believes in you. And you are never alone in the fight.

Once this clicks, you’ll have more than enough motivation to get you out of the loophole, back to your old self: the fruitful version of yourself that you enjoy being. You might perceive yourself as imperfect and full of flaws, but you’re just happy to be… you, and that is enough. 

To keep this momentum, remember Newton: motion resists change. The hardest part is starting and overcoming the initial friction: the self-doubt, jumping to conclusions, or whatever it may be. Once you push past this, consistency carries you. In physics terms, you maintain your your  $F_{\text{net}}=0$, and you keep moving. Small, repeated actions—routines, journaling, calls to friends, fifteen minutes of reading—keep the cycle alive. And rest. Remember, momentum is not infinite. After all, we’re humans: moral, weak, but yet full of potential. You need to recharge so that your next sprint will be stronger than ever. 

To end, consider this quote from the Ghibli film *The Wind Rises:*

> Stop trying. Take long walks. Look at the scenery. Doze off at noon. Don't even think about flying. And then, pretty soon, you'll be flying again.

You **will** fly again. There are always people rooting for you. Take breaks. Breathe. Observe. And when you are ready, run slowly, accelerate, and start flying into your horizon.
